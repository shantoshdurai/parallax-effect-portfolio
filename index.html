                    <p>I build stuff that is really meant to help people in their daily lives. My goal is to build things that provide people with a better experience, just like an entrepreneur would want.</p>
                    <p>Like every other person, I also got into engineering, but I've always had a strong interest in artificial intelligence since childhood after watching a movie called Robot. Since then, I've been fascinated by the cyberpunk genre. Now, as the world is evolving in that direction, I'm excited to be part of this transformation.</p>

                <p>I've seen people who hate AI, some people don't know about AI, some don't understand AI's impact, and that's okay. AI might take over many of our tasks, but it can't replace human curiosity and hunger, which puts us at the top. When it comes to answering questions, AI can perform better than us, so why compete with it? Let's change our approach and start asking it questions. How to solve this? What is this? Why is that? Learning is a never-ending process, and we're here to learn and live the lives we want, not just to memorize long answers for exams. So with that, I encourage you to get creative and rock on!</p>
